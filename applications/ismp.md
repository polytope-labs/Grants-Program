## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
The Interoperable State Machine Protocol, or ISMP for short, is the product of our [research](https://research.polytope.technology/state-(machine)-proofs) in to state proofs. We show that state-proof based interoperability is possible and more efficient as the messages no longer need to be routed through the relay chain and can be exchanged independent of it, while still maintaining the same level of trustlessness and security. This protocol allows not just for messaging but also [state reads of other parachains](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5087) in a trustless and secure manner.

Unfortunately, Parachain-to-Parachain communication today relies on the relay chain for message routing. This is highly inefficient and relieving the relay chain of this burden will allow for better Parachain throughput and scalability. We believe ISMP is the end-game for parachain interoperability, with the relevant ISMP modules, each parachain can send and receive messages and assets to and from other parachains which also have the ISMP modules.

## Project Details

ISMP is a simple protocol for state machines to send requests that can be handled by a counterparty chain. Akin to the HTTP paradigm in web2, parachains can issue GET-like requests for storage reads as well as POST-like requests for sending data.

Requests are stored in a merkle mountain range tree on the sending chain as this data structure provides some benefits, binary merkle trees have more compact proof sizes than patricia merkle tries, and in particular, merkle mountain range trees have much smaller proof sizes for recently inserted items in the tree. We believe this choice will enable higher bandwidth parachain <> parachain messaging with smaller proof sizes.

ISMP will also support request timeouts, allowing for a more safer parachain <> parachain messaging.

![Architecture](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1t8Qow88En3-ZCW7P0LYjRnbSqzFS30be)

```rust
use sp_storage::{StorageKey, StorageValue};

#[runtime_interface]
trait RelayChainStorageProvider {
  /// Read the relay chain storage at a specified key
  fn read_storage(key: StorageKey) -> StorageValue;
}
```

### **`pallet-ismp`**
This serves as the foundational element for state-proof based messaging between parachains, enabling state reads of the relay chain directly from any given parachain, granting the ability to verify incoming messages and data from other parachains under the shared security umbrella of the relay chain.

**Custom crates**

-  `ismp-rust` - A set of primitives necessary for pallet-ismp
   -  `ISMPHost`: Represents a state machine's core functionality
   -  `ISMPRouter`: Embodies the request and response primitives for parachain interactions
   -  `ConsensusClient`: Logic for consensus proof verification
   
This module will also allow for highly sophisticated messaging protocols, allowing for message timeouts and can serve as an alternative transport layer for XCM messages.

#### **Cumulus**
In addition to `pallet-ismp` will be a new host function `RelayChainStorageProvider` added to `parachain-system` and `pvf`, leveraging the Relay chain as a consensus oracle for verifying incoming requests and responses proofs from other parachains with their associated headers in the Relay chain storage.

### Ecosystem Fit

Currently messages are sent over the Relay Chain through opening HRMP channels but through ISMP we can increase the bandwidth of messaging between parachains without burdening the relay chain with these messages. This allows the relay chain to focus on its main task: enforcing the validity of parachain state transitions.
